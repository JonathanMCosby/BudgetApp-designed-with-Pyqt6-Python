Jonathan Michael Cosby completely built this program including front-end and back-end work also the database. I created this project to keep track of the paychecks I was getting from my job and my side hustles. Yes, I could have downloaded an already built application that could have easily helped me but I decided to put effort into using the skills I've learned and also learn some more skills to solve my problem. This program took almost 1-2 months since I was doing it in my off time between classes, work, and other side hustles like reselling items on eBay, day trading, and editing content for my friends. I'm pleased with the outcome of this project especially with it being my very first. My next steps with this program are to learn Swift and create an IOS App with added functions.
