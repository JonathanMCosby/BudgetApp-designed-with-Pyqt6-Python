This program was completely built by Jonathan Michael Cosby including front-end and back-end work. I created this project to be able to keep track of my paychecks I was getting from my job and also my side hustles. Yes I couldv'e downloaded an already built application that could have easily helped me but I decided to put effort into using the skills I've learned and also learn some more skills to solve my own problem. This program took almost 1-2 months since I was doing it in my off time between classes, work, and also other side hustles like reselling items on ebay, day-trading and editing content for my friends. I'm pleased with the outcome of this project especially with it being my very first.
